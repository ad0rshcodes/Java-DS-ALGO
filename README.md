# Java -DS-ALGO


Data structure and Algorithms are a crucial part of job interviews and a must-have knowledge for all software developers. I am currently learning DS Algo in Java from the [Kunal kushwaha](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ) playlist on YouTube. 

## How can this repository help you?

While many people want to read **some books** and want **notes** in Data Structures and Algorithms, I am a part of that crowd. 
Therefore, in this repository, you will find **comments** that can be used as a theory. 
You don't have to refer to a book or **google search(though it's recommended)** about what the particular statement is doing. 

## From where to practise?

With a bunch of resources available in the market to polish our knowledge. I have selected [**Code forces**](https://codeforces.com/) & [**Leet Code**](https://leetcode.com/). 
The solution to the questions are in ```com.practises``` folder. 
Have a look at the problems if you are stuck somewhere ;)
